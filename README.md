# QR Code Generator
   The QR Code Generator project is a user-friendly application built with Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to easily create customized QR codes for text, URLs, or other data.
# Key Features
## 1). Interactive GUI:
   The application features an intuitive graphical user interface created using Tkinter. Users can input their data, adjust settings, and generate QR codes without needing to write any code.
## 2). Data Input Options:
The program accepts text, URLs, or other alphanumeric data, which will be encoded into a QR code.
## 3).	QR Code Customization:
   a). Set QR code size and border thickness.
  
   b). Choose different error correction levels for enhanced flexibility.
## 4). Save Feature:
Users can save the generated QR code as an image file (e.g., PNG) to their local storage for use in websites, documents, or printing.
## 5). Cross-Platform Compatibility:
The project runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems as long as Python and required libraries are installed.
# Technical Details
## 1). Libraries Used:
   a). Tkinter: For creating the graphical interface.
   
   b). qrcode: For generating QR codes.
## 2). Core Components:
   a). A Tkinter Entry widget for user input.
